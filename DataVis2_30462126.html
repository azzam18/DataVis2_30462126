        <em>The G20 (or "Group of Twenty") is a collaborative forum of the world's 19 largest economies and the European Union. This visualisation shall highlight the significant financial differences between the given states. Such disparities are identified by differences between the GDP (or related measures) of the given G20 nations.
          Thus, the levels of income within G20 nations can somewhat be correlated to their overall economic development.

          <h2><font size="+1"> Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the World</font></h2>
          <p>Despite a global recession via the "Financial Crisis of 2008" a decade before the given time-frame, GDP when accounting for population remains relatively high. Especially concentrated in the developed "Western World" and "Far East" regions. With certain high-income pockets in Oceania, Arab Peninsula, and Levant. Note that nations that have recently experienced economic/political turmoil have GDP (per capita) levels too eratic to register within legitimate records.</p>

          <h2><font size="+1">Economic Trends Accounting for Population</font></h2>
          <p>The line chart on the left selects the 'top 4' wealthist nations (population size accounted for) from each relevant HDI status. Note, HDI (or Human Development Index) factors life expectancy, education, and national per capita income into tiers of development. Here, despite notable fluctuations in the second half of the 20th century, the individual wealth of these selected nations are clearly defined.</p>
          <div id = "vis2"></div>
          <div id = "vis3"></div>
          <p> The only exception being Saudi Arabia and South Korea (Korea, Rep.) of whose development tier is more dependent on population health and quality of education rather than income. The line chart layered with raw data (right) emphasises this difference, as the "developed" section has clearly experienced more growth in individual income over time - thus, a relatively steeper trend.</p>

          <h2><font size="+1">Notable Characteristics Given HDI Status</font></h2>
          <p>Based on the horizontal boxplot, developed countries cover a greater range. Such is reflective of relatively greater economic growth/expansion (especially) throughout the 20th century. This is also indicative that western powers tend to have higher liveability levels than their counterparts (in this case, Australia, Canada, and the US). Note, the given nations were selected as they represented their respective HDI levels more accurately.</p>
          <div id = "vis4"></div>
          <div id = "vis5"></div>
          <p>The bubble chart demonstrates that as a nation expands and enriches its economy, price levels (inflation) tend to normalise around steady (weak) growth and job opportunities arise (or are fulfilled) at a higher frequency. Thus, with economic development, nations (with the example of the G20) are expected to crawl/approach weak inflation (~2%) and (relatively) low unemployment rates.</p>
